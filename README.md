Video surveillance for ESP32 Cam

## Getting Started

This project is made with Flutter 3.10.6 

I originally designed it to be able to view several ESP32 cameras connected to the local network, although it can also be used for other projects in which IP cameras are used.
Currently the application can take a capture of the view you have, it is also planned to add a recording of the videos provided by the camera.
